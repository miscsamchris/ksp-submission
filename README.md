### Problem Statement - Product Name: LeetView Analytics
1) Traditional monitoring systems only rely on fiat money transactions to find fraudulent actors and money laundering activities being done. In our product, we have incoporated the concept of money laundering via cryptocurrency which has become one of the new routes to launder money. We also have the fiat money monitoring along with cryptocurrency transactions analysis system
2) We have also built a smart scoring system using ML Algorithms through which we will be flagging the actors as legit or malicious on the interface which can be used to automate the process of warrant generation
